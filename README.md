# CODE CHALLENGE

## Description
A series of python toy problems.

### Objectives
1. Converting 12-hour time to 24-hour time.
This challenge involves writing a function that converts a 12-hour time format to a 24-hour time format. The function takes an hour, minute, and period as inputs and returns the time in a four-digit string format in 24-hour time.

2. Two numbers are positive.
Implement a function that determines whether exactly two out of three given integers are positive numbers. The function takes three integers as inputs and returns `True` if exactly two of them are positive, and `False` otherwise.

3. Consonant value.
This challenge involves calculating the highest value of consonant substrings in a given lowercase string containing only alphabetic characters. Consonants are defined as any letters of the alphabet except "aeiou".
